# Wiztaqnia® — Electronics and Technology Digest

I'm **Noor Fatimah Iqbal Husain**, a technical writer and creator behind Wiztaqnia®.  
I write insightful blog posts on DIY electronics, programming, and tech trends.

This GitHub shares the **code, projects, and resources** behind my blog—so you can explore, build, and experiment with confidence.

At Wiztaqnia®, I believe:
